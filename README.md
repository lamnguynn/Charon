# Charon

This project is currently under development locally. I am not sharing any code until a alpha release or I feel comfortable with the model. 

But in case, you are curious....The model is trained on a mix of synthetic (cause im broke + no VC money) and real data, mixed with some other secret stuff to create the safe pathfinding.

### Why Charon?

Charon is a figure in Greek mythology that guides those through the Rivers Styx.
